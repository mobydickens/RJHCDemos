- Homepage (could be in app?)

Components (Toy Problems): 
- Create an app where there is an array of data on state that is then shown on the DOM as a list. There should also be a way for the user to filter what's shown in the list. The array of data can be as simple as an array of strings. The list can be as simple as a list of <h2> elements.
- Create a Login component that has two text inputs, one for a username and one for a password, and a button to login the user. When the login button is clicked, an alert should be showed to the user that displays what the user typed in for the username and password.
- Create an app similiar to question #6, except this time add a new third component called NewTask. NewTask should be responsible for adding a new task to a task array on the App component. Also add a new fourth functional component called List. List should be responsible for display the tasks inside of a task array on the App component in a list-like fashion.
- Create an app hitting an API of your choice (swapi.co, birdapi.com, pokeapi, smurfs, marvel api, etc). The API should be hit as soon as the component is finished rendering. The app should set value(s) on state based on results from the API and then show the propertie(s) on state in the DOM.
